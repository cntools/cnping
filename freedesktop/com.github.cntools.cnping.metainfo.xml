    <p>
        cnping is a minimal graphical real time IPv4 ping tool written in C.
It can send pings via ICMP (regular ping) or HTTP which is useful 
in case ICMP is prohibited. Responses are displayed as vertical bars 
in a graphical window. Red bars indicate a response was not (yet) 
received, white bars indicate the response was received with a height 
relative to the round trip time. Additional statistics are displayed 
as an overlay.
    </p>
    <p>
        cnping uses rawdraw so it is OS independent and very light weight.
